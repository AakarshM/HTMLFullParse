# HTMLFullParse

HTMLFullParse is an Android app that is effective for finding the HTML codes of small websites. This is app does something similar to "page source," in web browsers. The JSOUP library was used extensively in the app. This is not very efficient for large website because the amount of code on large websites creates too many rows in the scrollview of the app.
